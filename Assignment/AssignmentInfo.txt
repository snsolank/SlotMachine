Name: Samarth Solanki

➢	There are two php files in my project named Assignment. 

1) db.php
2) form.php

➢	The player ID value in database is “Samarth”

➢	The Salt value is “thisisatest12345678123” which is known by the player, according to the assignment.

➢	The file db.php contains all the main functionalities of this assignment. 

➢	I have used blowfish algorithm to implement the hash value. 

➢	The hash value and player ID data submitted through client request is compared with the hash value and player ID data stored in the database. 

➢	The form.php is a user interface, which prompts the player to input Coins Won, Coins Bet, Player ID fields. 

➢	The PlayerID field has a value “Samarth”, any other value will throw an error “Data no Valid”.
